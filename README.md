## Description
The program initially displays a list of 10 randomly selected movies for the user to rate. 
The user can enter their ratings using the corresponding slider objects.
The user has three options:
* Choose to review and rate an additional 10 movies.
* View all recommended movies.
* Apply filters to the list of recommended movies. Filters cover genre and release year.
Movie recommendations are limited to 10 movies and are sorted based on recommendation. 
Recommendations are determined by comparing the user's rating history to a dataset of movie critics and their ratings.
Critics with similar tastes to the user are weighted higher than others to calculate a weighted average score for each movie.
Movies with the highest average score are recommended to the user.
